# Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer NanoDegree - Term 2

The second term of the nanodegree focused on sensor fusion, localization and control.

## Preparation
To build the projects CMake, make, and gcc/g++ have to be available on your system.
To test the projects the Udacity Term 2 simulator has to be installed. The projects communicate with the simulator using uWebSocketIO. There are installation instructions in the individual projects.

## Overview

### Project 1: Extended Kalman Filters (C++)
Utilize an extended Kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

### Project 2: Unscented Kalman Filters (C++)
Utilize an unscented Kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

### Project 3: Kidnapped Vehicle (C++)
Localize a vehicle using a map and a particle filter.

### Project 4: PID controller (C++)
Create a PID-controller to guide a car around a track using predetermined waypoints.

### Project 5: Model Predictive Controller (C++)
Navigate a car around a predetermined path on a track using a model predictive controller.
