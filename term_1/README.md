# Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer NanoDegree Term 1 Projects

The first term of the nanodegree focused on computer vision and deep learning.

## Preparation

To run the projects of this term, first install [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) on your system.
Next create a conda environment using the configuration file from the starter kit made available by Udacity [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit). Use environment.yml to run on a CPU only or environment-gpu.yml to make use of your GPU. For the latter case CUDA and cuDNN have to be installed first.

## Overview

### Project 1: Lane Line Detection (Python, Jupyter Notebook)
Introductary project to familiarize the students with jupyter notebooks, python and OpenCV. Detect straight lane lines on pictures and video of a highway.

### Project 2: Traffic Sign Classifier (Python, Jupyter Notebook)
Design, train and test a convolutional neural network to classify images of traffic signs. Analyze the performance of the network.

### Project 3: Behavioral Cloning (Python)
Use behavioral cloning to teach a deep neural network to drive a car around a track in the Udacity Simulator.

### Project 4: Advanced Lane Detection (Python)
Detect lanes on pictures and video of a highway using more advanced techniques.

### Project 5: Vehicle Detection (Python)
Detect vehicles and estimate bounding boxes in a video using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction and heat maps.
